		Idea!
		
			2D platformer, very square world
			World is split into layers .... like levels and sections as you go deeper the game is harder and darker.

			player is returning from a journey and finds his city in runis, and goes to find the cause.

			player is a Indi ana Jones like person (to big a scope?)
				- to many level.

			
			* GOING WITH THIS IDEA FOR NOW * 

			broken city, few survivers, mine like motherload to build up your charcter and exploer the under ground. upgrades?

				- light scources? minecraft like mob spawns
				- random gen level

			*				*


			Binding of issiac?

			lemmings? micro management, top down drawfs!
